### 1. Build Model with FashionMNIST Dataset Part1, 2

The FashionMNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images, spread across 10 categories of fashion items, offering a more challenging alternative to the classic MNIST dataset.
A model has been constructed and assessed based on this dataset.

Part 1 uses only a single linear layer. In Part 2, multiple layers are utilized through nn.Sequential, and each layer is complemented with nn.Linear and nn.ReLU (an activation function). This arrangement allows for more extensive computations and the learning of more complex patterns, thereby enabling an improvement in accuracy.

Part 1 Accuracy: 0.8438  [[code](https://github.com/Kdavid2355/seoultech_ai/blob/main/FashionMNIST_PyTorch_Tutorial1.ipynb)]  |  Part 2 Accuracy: 0.8787 [[code](https://github.com/Kdavid2355/seoultech_ai/blob/main/FashionMNIST_PyTorch_Tutorial2.ipynb)]
